# CloudTool

A tool to hide the complexity of the cloud

## TODOs

- [x] Add example of how to use the tool (simple fastapi app)
- [x] Add `cli` app with `deploy`, `destroy` commands (clap library)
- [x] Add `cloud` app to interact with the cloud (aws for now)
- [ ] Deploy the fastapi app to the cloud
