# CloudTool

A tool to hide the complexity of the cloud

## TODOs

### [PoC] Deploy simple rest service to the cloud:

- [x] Add example of how to use the tool (simple fastapi app)
- [x] Add `cli` app with `deploy`, `destroy` commands (clap library)
- [x] Add `cloud` app to interact with the cloud (aws for now)
- [x] Deploy the fastapi app to the cloud

### Next steps:

- [ ] Add config file for the cloud deploying services
- [ ] Add support for multiple cloud providers
- [ ] Add support for multiple cloud regions
- [ ] Add UI for monitoring and configuring the cloud
- [ ] Add security for the cloud (connect from specific ip address)
